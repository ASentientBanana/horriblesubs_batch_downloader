# HorribleSubsBatchDownloader

Often times I find that HorribleSubs does not upload a single torrent containing all episodes of an anime.

This scraper will search all their shows given a search word (via command line or after prompt during program execution), and download all
episodes of the desired show in the highest resolution available.


### Requirements

##### Python 2.7

##### Modules

* cfscrape
* scrapy

##### `xdg-open` if using Unix

##### Software that can download content from a magnet link (e.g.: transmission, tixati, etc.)
