# HorribleSubsBatchDownloader

Often times I find that HorribleSubs does not upload a single torrent containing all episodes of an anime.

This scraper will search all their shows given a search word (via command line or after prompt during program execution), and download all
episodes of the desired show in the highest resolution available.
